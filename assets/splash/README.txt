Splash Screen Directory
=======================

Place PNG or JPG images in this directory to display splash screens
while videos are loading.

The application will cycle through images in this directory based on
the splash screen configuration in config.toml.

If no splash images are provided, the application will show a default
splash screen with the application logo.
